# 🦁 Welcome to Team CUITS Repo for the NASA SUITS Challenge (2023-2024)! 🚀💻

## Introduction
ROARR, Space Cadets! You've landed in the cosmic command center of Team CUITS of the Columbia Space Initiative, boldly venturing into the NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) Challenge for the stellar year 2023-2024! Prepare for an intergalactic coding adventure.

## Contribution Guidelines
To navigate the stars with us, here are the rules for contributing to the NASA SUITS repository:

### 1. Branching Strategy
- 🌲 Ensure you've got your own branch for your cosmic contributions. Branch names should be the name of the explorer working on that branch.
  Example: `moises`

- 📬 If you're feeling lost in the cosmic sea, signal our wise leaders - Moises or Jonah, to receive your territory in the codebase!

### 2. Unity Etiquette
- 🚀 ALWAYS close Unity before committing and pushing to your branch. Let's avoid space-time paradoxes and keep our coding universe in order.
- Make sure to be on `Unity Editor Version 2022.3.7`

### 3. Merging to Main
- 🚀 Merges to the main branch will be celebrated during our out-of-this-world group meetings. Keep your creations on your own branch until the cosmic council approves a merge.
