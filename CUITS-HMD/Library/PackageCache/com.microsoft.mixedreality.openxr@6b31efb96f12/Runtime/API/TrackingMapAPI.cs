    /// When first entering the Application-Exclusive tracking mode, the calling application will be issued a unique identifier
    /// that can be used to resume tracking the app-specific map in future sessions of the application
    /// (like if the user switches away from the application and it is terminated in the background due to system resource constraints).
    /// However, if the device simply goes to sleep or the user briefly interacts with the Shell,
    /// the application will automatically resume in the Application-Exclusive tracking mode once it is reactivated (and all application state will remain available).

    /// <remarks>
    /// There are two limitations to be aware of when using the Application-Exclusive tracking mode:
    /// <list type="number">
    /// <item>Only a single Application-Exclusive tracking map can exist on the HoloLens at one time. If an application requests a new Application-Exclusive tracking mode,
    /// then any previous Application-Exclusive tracking data would be erased and all SpatialAnchor objects (and attached holograms) would be lost,
    /// even if the data was created by a completely different application using its own Application-Exclusive tracking mode.
    /// Therefore, attempting to return to a previous Application-Exclusive map (by specifying the identifier received when this map was created)
    /// may result in a return value indicating that the previous map was not found.
    /// Applications must be prepared to handle the scenario where a previous Application-Exclusive tracking map is not available.</item>
    /// <item>The disk storage available to the Application-Exclusive tracking mode is limited to one third of what is available for the Device Shared tracking mode,
    /// although this is unlikely to be an issue for most users. When this limit is reached, HoloLens will begin erasing its least valuable tracking data,
    /// which will eventually result in poorer tracking accuracy.
    /// The smaller limit is still large enough to maintain good accuracy for house-sized environments and is unlikely to be a concern for most application scenarios.</item>
    /// </list>
    /// <para>Given these limitations, the target scenario for the Application-Exclusive tracking mode is for applications with high accuracy requirements that are task oriented,
    /// where a task may be interrupted by the user returning the HoloLens Shell or the device going to sleep.
    /// However, once the user's task is complete, nothing about the task (with respect to the 3D environment) needs to be saved and so can be erased.
    /// </para>
